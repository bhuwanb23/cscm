# Routing & Logistics Optimization Module

## Overview

This module provides routing and logistics optimization capabilities for the Cognitive Supply Chain Mesh (CSCM) AI/ML system.

## Phase 1: Classical Optimization ✅

### Components

1. **CVRPTW Solver** (`classical_optimization/cvrptw_solver.py`)
   - Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows
   - Uses Google OR-Tools constraint solver
   - Supports capacity and time window constraints
   - Distance and time matrix support

2. **Gurobi Routing Optimizer** (`classical_optimization/gurobi_routing.py`)
   - MIP-based routing optimization using Gurobi
   - Handles capacity and time window constraints
   - Flow conservation constraints
   - Big-M formulation for time propagation

3. **Time Window Handler** (`classical_optimization/time_windows.py`)
   - Time window validation and adjustment
   - Soft and hard time window constraints
   - Penalty calculation for violations
   - Route feasibility checking
   - Time window merging

See `classical_optimization/README.md` for detailed usage examples.

## Phase 2: ML-Augmented Approaches ✅

### Components

1. **Graph Neural Networks** (`ml_augmented/gnn_route_planner.py`)
   - GCN and GAT architectures for route planning
   - Node embedding learning
   - Route generation using learned embeddings

2. **Learned Heuristics** (`ml_augmented/learned_heuristics.py`)
   - Hybrid heuristics combining classical and learned components
   - Nearest neighbor and time window heuristics
   - GNN-enhanced route selection

3. **RL-based Routing** (`ml_augmented/rl_routing.py`)
   - MADDPG and PPO for routing optimization
   - Routing environment for RL training
   - Reward functions for route optimization

See `ml_augmented/README.md` for detailed usage examples.

## Phase 3: Predictive Models ✅

### Components

1. **Gradient-Boosted Models** (`predictive_models/travel_time_prediction.py`)
   - XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost for travel time prediction
   - Feature extraction and importance analysis
   - Uncertainty estimation

2. **LSTM ETA Models** (`predictive_models/lstm_eta.py`)
   - LSTM architecture for sequence-based ETA prediction
   - Time-series modeling for arrival times

3. **Transformer Routing** (`predictive_models/transformer_routing.py`)
   - Small transformer models for routing predictions
   - Multi-head attention mechanisms
   - Edge deployment ready

See `predictive_models/README.md` for detailed usage examples.
